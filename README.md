# Logistics-Case-Study

The current project analyzes time-series demand forecasting for a supply chain dataset, based on 3 years of data. Linear first-order autoregression with integrated moving average (ARIMA) yields overfitting results on the train set. Usage of various models does not lower the mean absolute error of the predicted values. Recommendations include introducing VARMA models, solving the problem as a multi-variable linear regression problem. 

Other case studies that can be constructed based on the data set include classifying whether a particular delivery will be late, and by how many days, based on other variables. 

The Jupyter notebook with the code can be found <a href='https://github.com/shubacca/Logistics-Case-Study/blob/master/Logistics%20Use%20Case%20-%20Mini%20Project.ipynb'> here. </a>
